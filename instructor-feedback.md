## Exceeds Specs

### Organize: At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file

I have two pieces of functionality that have been refactored into its own file: the moving_average() function as well as two ggplot themes I created for my graphs. Both are in the R folder.

### Document: The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works

My README is well-organized with a step-by-step description of what my repo does, as well as where to find each part of the process within my project. I also include the attempted final product (with citations), and a fun flowchart that I believe summarizes my workflow in a visually-appealing manner.

## Collaboration

Peer collaboration was a good way to see where others were in their project and aid them from my own expertise. For example, working with Kylie helped both of us think about the vertical lines in our plot. It was also interesting to look at Kylie's code because she used the faceting approach, whereas I combined my plots with patchwork. Working with Ava, I was able to point out the lack of an outputs folder, and also help her find the correct code to save a csv file. This helped her save time because she didn't have to Google it like I did!

## Automate

[M] **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**

[M] The analysis runs without errors

[M] **The analysis produces the expected output**

[M] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

## Organize

[M] Raw data is contained in its own folder

[M] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

[E] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

- Great work!! Putting the theme in its own function is very creative.

## Document

[M] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

[E] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

- Such a good flowchart! The split-patchwork-combine part clearly shows how the figure is assembled.

[M] **The code is appropriately commented**

[M] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**

## Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:

[M] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

[M] The analysis script runs without errors
